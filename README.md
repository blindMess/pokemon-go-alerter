This script records the visible Pokemon in a given area and then alerts Slack channels (Discord soon!) with their locations. The code is a mess, but shouldn't be for too long.

The credit for this project really goes to [leegao's work](https://github.com/leegao/pokemongo-api-demo) and others. I'm just a lowly web developer -- they're the real heroes.

## Configuration

Rename `config.template.json` to `config.json` and fill out the required information. 

Your username and password need to be Pokemon Trainer Club credentials. Registration is a little tricky, but refreshing their registration page a lot or registering late at night (midnight EST) seems to help. In the future, this should support Google Auth as well.

Location can be GPS coordinates or an address.

To avoid spamming the channel with common Pokemon, set filterCommon to 1 and any Pokemon in the COMMON list in notifier.py will not be notified on.

Several Slack channels can be configured with different message delays like so:

```
"services": [
		{
			"name": "Slack Channel 1",
			"delay": 120,
			"webhook": "https://hooks.slack.com/services/something"
		},
		{
			"name": "Slack Channel 2",
			"delay": 60,
			"webhook": "https://hooks.slack.com/services/something_else"
		}
	]
```

The `delay` field is the minimum time in seconds between alerts. It's not exact, it's just a buffer to prevent your channel from being spammed (the latest commit to master disables this functionality -- need to fix!).

## Running

Using pip, install `requirements.txt`:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make changes to the configuration file, and then run the script:

```
$ python main.py
```
